## Education
- **M.S, Information Security**  
Norwegian Information Security Lab, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Gjovik, Norway

- **B.S, Computer Science (Erasmus Programme)**  
Malardalens University, Vasterous, Sweden

- **B.S, Computer Engineering**  
Isik University, Istanbul, Turkey

### Master's Thesis
- **Title:** Obfuscating Malware through Cache Memory Architecture Features
- **Supervisor:** Prof. Dr. Stephen Wolthusen
- **Description:** Developed theoretical methods for obfuscating malware in multi-processor systems using caches as a private memory to evade main memory observer systems and other conventional static data analysis. Explored cache behaviors and efficiency optimization and discussed implementation issues arising from interactions between cache coherence mechanisms and Harvard architecture implementations.

### Bachelor's Thesis
- **Title:** Bypassing Firewalls with Covered Channel Techniques
- **Supervisor:** Prof. Dr. Ercan Solak
- **Description:** Surveyed firewall bypassing techniques and proposed a practical and distributed DNS tunneling method to enhance communication anonymity.
